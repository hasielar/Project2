1,Best Ever Food Review Show,"I travel to unique parts of the world on the hunt for the best food each country has to offer and share these stories with you in my videos.

Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable wit or enjoyed watching me eat interesting food like sea penis, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. 

Best Ever Food Review Show is the first food review show exploring the unique foods of each country with a fresh point of view and a punchy delivery, encouraging empathy and understanding of other cultures along the way. From the best street food to the most insane food markets to...well...yes, sea penis, nothing is off limits (except cucumbers. Cucumbers are off limits).

Cooking and gardening are a few of my passions. I am sharing the recipes that we have enjoyed cooking for my loved ones for the last 15 years.

I started cooking as my wife required an extra hand to accomplish her lifelong love for cooking, and I have been helping her in the kitchen with whatever I could, especially with the cooking preparations. By doing so, I found that cooking is a beautiful thing to keep your family fed with healthy and fresh food that never can be expected when buying or dining out. I know I have found the love and passion for cooking; however, it is nowhere as good as my wife‚Äôs cooking and has a long way to go.

It allows travelers to interact with locals, sample traditional dishes, and discover hidden culinary gems that might not be found in restaurants or tourist hotspots. Street food vendors often take pride in their recipes, using traditional methods and locally sourced ingredients, which adds to the authenticity of the experience.

263,Jonny Shapland,"I'm creating this channel to document my journey, trying different side hustles, crypto projects and other forms of passive income.

My dream has always been to have my own businesses and Youtube has been my biggest source of inspiration. 

I am now living on the basis of ""If anyone can, why not you"" - Everything I have dreamed of, I will action out. Succeed or fail, I will document everything!

I hope that sharing my journey with you, I will be able to provide useful information on what things actually work. Providing you with the potential blueprint to live the life that you want.

With the correct approach and education I believe everyone can achieve this. And this channel is going to be my journey to prove you CAN do it.

345,Abraham Oros,"Hola Amigos!
A few years back, I decided that I wanted to devote the rest of my life to advocating for mental, spiritual, and physical health. I needed a plan. Here's that plan from a 10,000 ft perspective.
‚Äã
‚ÄãStep 1: Create time.
Achieve a level of financial literacy and ultimately independence that will allow for more time to devote to helping others.
‚ÄãStep 2: Education.
Become a licensed counselor.
‚ÄãStep 3: Spread the word.
Post Mental, Spiritual, and Physical Health content on various social media platforms starting with YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Podcast.

‚Äã‚ÄãMeanwhile, I intend to...
‚Äã* Have fun!
‚Äã* Stay mentally, physically, and spiritually healthy!
‚Äã* Love life!
‚Äã
‚ÄãJoin me on this journey and let's build a community together!

‚ú® Hey, y'all! I'm your friendly neighborhood chronic illness navigator on a messy journey to self-compassion and body acceptance. ‚òÄÔ∏è

üå± Join me for unfiltered personal stories and insights, honest conversations on mental illness, neurodivergence, and crushing the stigma surrounding invisible disabilities. Let's keep it real, raw, and remarkably resilient with my trusty PTSD pup by our side! üêæ

üó£Ô∏è I'm creating content to form a space where young me would have felt seen, heard, and less alone. My journey from a restrictive eating disorder to a signed professional curve model has shown me that believing you are enough is a powerful act of rebellion against hyper-critical standards. No one should ever have to shrink themselves to feel they are worthy. ü¶ã

‚òïÔ∏è In a world that often feels isolating, I share the chaotic details of my experiences, hoping to create a ripple effect of empathy, curiosity, and a sense of community. üåä
